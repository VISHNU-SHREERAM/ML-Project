# Predicting Stress and Sleep Disorders Using Health and Lifestyle Data
- This project explores **machine learning for mental health**, 
- specifically predicting **human stress levels** from physiological and behavioral signals.  
- It was developed as part of **Introduction to Machine Learning** at **IIT Palakkad**.

---

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
Stress is a critical factor affecting mental and physical well-being. Our project leverages **supervised learning techniques** to classify stress levels (e.g., low, medium, high) based on features extracted from sensor and questionnaire data.  

Key Highlights:  
- Preprocessing of real-world physiological datasets (EDA, heart rate, etc.)  
- Feature engineering for stress-related markers  
- Training and evaluation of multiple ML models  
- Comparative analysis of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Documentation of pipeline for reproducibility

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- Regression
    - Achieved **85% accuracy**  with XGBOOST (regressor).  
- Classification
    - Achieved **80% accuracy** with SVM SVC (classifier).
- Notable improvement over baseline methods.  
- Insights into feature importance (e.g., heart rate variability as strongest predictor).  

*(Optional: add a confusion matrix / accuracy table screenshot in `/results`)*
